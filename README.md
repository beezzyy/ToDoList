# PERN Todo List Applicationüìù

This is a simple todo list application built using the PERN stack, which stands for PostgreSQL, Express, React, and Node. The application allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks to keep track of their todo list.

The objective of this personal project was to gain familiarity with PostgreSQL and hosting on Render. It was a great learning experience, and I feel more confident using these tools in future projects.
